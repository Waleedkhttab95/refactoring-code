# Refactoring Code

## Overview

This document outlines the process for refactoring code to address common issues related to security, error handling, and response management.

## Identified Problems and Solutions

### 1. SQL Injection

**Issue:** The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to direct insertion of user input into SQL queries.

**Solution:**
- We need to make sure from the user input , validation on the input and Escape query values by using the placeholder ? method to avoid send params directly to query. 


### 2. Error Handling

**Issue:** The current error handling approach is inadequate, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions and poor user feedback.

**Solution:**
- check and add error responses with error details . 

### 3. HTTP Status Codes

**Issue:** The application lacks appropriate HTTP status codes for different responses.

**Solution:**
-  add status code for each response . 
## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Parameterize Queries:** Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
2. **Add Error Handling:** Use try-catch blocks or equivalent error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
3. **Use Appropriate Status Codes:** Ensure that all responses include the correct HTTP status codes and follow best practices for API responses.
